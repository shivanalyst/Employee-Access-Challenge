# Employee Access Challenge

Whenever a new employee joins an organization, he/she has to undertake multiple access which are required to perform the task. Till now, this process is done manually, where employees are either given access or denied. The employees are given access to particular resources of the organization based on their job profile, cadre and security restrictions. This is an iterative process as no new employee knows the list of all the accesses required before commencing the work. This problem is also encountered when an existing employee is transferred to some other location or department. This in turn, leads to wastage of time and money.

In order to address the issue, ML models can be developed based on enormous data available with the company regarding each employee. The developed model will in turn help in providing auto-access as and when required without much human interference. ML model has to be developed, which analyses whether an employee have the listed characteristics. If employee possess the same, then access is granted else access declined.
